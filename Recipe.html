        Here's what you'll need:
      <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup  granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup  brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon  salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup melted butter</li>
        <li>1 egg </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon  vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 + 1/4 cups flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon  baking soda</li>
        <li>220 g of chocolate chunk</li>
        
        
      </ul>
      
            Here are the steps:
      <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps. </li>
        <li> Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.</li>
        <li> Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture. </li>
        <li> Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be..</li>
        <li> Preheat oven to 180°C. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 10 cm of space between cookies and 5 cm of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly</li>
        <li> Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown</li>
